\ifStatement
A light beam is travelling from vertically infinite region 1 to vertically infinite region 4 (refer to figure). The refractive indexes in regions 1, 2, 3, 4 are \num{1.62}, \num{1.60}, \num{1.55}, and \num{1.50}, respectively. The sin of angle of incidence $\theta$ for which the beam just misses entering region 4 is
