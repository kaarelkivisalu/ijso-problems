\ifStatement
Heater of an electric kettle is made of a wire of length $L$ and diameter $d$. It takes 4 minutes to raise the temperature of \SI{0.5}{\kg} of water by \SI{40}{\K} when connected to a line voltage source. This heater is replaced by a new heater having two wires of the same material as that of the frist one, each of length $L$ and diameter $2d$. Which of the following options is correct regarding the time taken for heating the same amount of water through the same temperature difference? (The entire system is thermally insulated)
