\ifStatement
A small, \SI{4.00}{\g} plastic ball of electric charge \SI{3.00}{\micro\C} is  suspended by a \SI{20.0}{\cm} long string in a uniform electric field as shown in the figure. If the ball is in equilibrium when the string makes an angle $q$ with the vertical, what is the linear displacement of the ball between the position at which $q$ equals zero and the equilibrium position?
