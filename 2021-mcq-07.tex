\ifStatement
When two mechanical waves meet in a small region of space, superposition of the two waves takes place. This is known as interference of waves. Which of the following statements is false?
\fi


\ifOption1
The resultant displacement of the two waves can be obtained by adding their individual displacements.
\fi


\ifOption2
The waves leaving the region carry less energy than the waves had before interference.
\fi


\ifOption3
The frequency of each wave does not change after interference.
\fi


\ifOption4
After leaving the region, the characteristics of the waves remain same as before interference.
