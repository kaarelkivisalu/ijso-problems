\ifStatement
The Museum of Islamic Art is one of the most important cultural achievements of the State of Qatar. One of its many collections is a golden enamelled falcon statue related to the  Mughal period, India, 17th century. It has a mass of 152 grams and is made of gold and copper alloy. Assuming it were to be heated to \SI{96.72}{\degreeCelsius} and then dropped into \SI{13.40}{\g} water at \SI{20.00}{\degreeCelsius}, the temperature of the water after thermal equilibrium was reached at \SI{46.97}{\degreeCelsius}. What is the percent by mass of copper in  the golden enamelled falcon assuming no heat was lost? Specific heat of gold = \SI{0.129}{\J\per\g\per\degreeCelsius}, specific heat of copper  = \SI{0.389}{\J\per\g\per\degreeCelsius}, specific heat of water = \SI{4.184}{\J\per\g\per\degreeCelsius}.
