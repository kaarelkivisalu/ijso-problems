\ifStatement
All kinds of life on earth require water, which cycles through our ecosystem in three states:  solid, liquid, and gas. The relationship that these phases have with both temperature and  pressure in a sealed container are best represented in the phase diagram below.
\begin{center}

\end{center}
Consider the following statements and identify the correct ones:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The bold line that separates any two regions shows that two phases of water co-exist in equilibrium.
  \item A decrease in pressure lowers the melting point and raises the boiling point of water.
  \item At a temperature of \SI{0.01}{\degreeCelsius} and a pressure \SI{0.06}{atm} ice, liquid water and water vapour  can co-exist in equilibrium.
  \item At \SI{100}{\degreeCelsius} the vapour pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure at sea level.
\end{enumerate}
