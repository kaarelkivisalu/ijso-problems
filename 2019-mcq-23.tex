\ifStatement
A metallic wire of diameter \SI{\pi}{\mm} was made into a circular loop of radius \SI{4\pi}{\cm} and was connected to an electric circuit. The potential difference between  terminals ($c$, $d$) and the current passing in the circuit are shown in the figure. What do you expect the conductivity of the wire to be? Consider $\pi$ to be \num{3.14}.
