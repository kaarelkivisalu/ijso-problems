\ifStatement
A disk-shaped cork of diameter $d$ is placed in water. Paper clips are added on the top of the cork. We repeat this experiment replacing water with cooking oil. Which of the following relationships expresses the maximum number of paper clips that can be added in the two situations before the cork fully submerges under the liquid? $n$ refers to the number of clips, $\rho$ refers to density, ``w'' refers to water and ``o'' refers to oil, and ``c'' refers to cork.

\ifOption1
$\frac{n_w}{n_o}=\frac{(\rho_o+\rho_c)}{(\rho_c-\rho_w)}$
\fi


\ifOption2
$\frac{n_w}{n_o}=\frac{(\rho_o-\rho_c)}{(\rho_c-\rho_w)}$
\fi


\ifOption3
$\frac{n_w}{n_o}=\frac{(\rho_w-\rho_c)}{(\rho_o-\rho_c)}$
\fi


\ifOption4
$\frac{n_w}{n_o}=\frac{(\rho_c-\rho_w)}{(\rho_o-\rho_c)}$
