\ifStatement
In a physics lab, the teacher decided to test the students' ability to set up electrical circuits and  asked them to set up the circuit shown in the figure. Each student was given a combination of 3 resistors of (\SI{2.00}{\ohm}, \SI{4.00}{\ohm} and \SI{6.00}{\ohm}) and 2 ideal batteries of (\SI{8.00}{\V} and \SI{12.00}{\V}).  The teacher later wanted to assess the students' work, but she did not have enough time to  examine each circuit connection. Therefore, she decided to use a voltmeter to measure the voltage between points $c$ and $d$ for each studentâ€™s circuit. What would be the voltmeter reading in case of correct connection?
