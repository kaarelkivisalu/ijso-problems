\ifStatement
A beam of light in air hits a block of three layers of different transparent materials stacked  on top of each other as shown in the figure. The thickness of each layer is \SI{10}{cm}. The index  of refraction of the layers are: $n_1=\num{2.40}$, $n_2=\num{2.00}$ and $n_3=\num{1.50}$. If the incident angle  of the light is \SI{75.0}{\degree}, find how far laterally from the vertical line marked $Y$ will the beam of light exit on the $X$-axis.
