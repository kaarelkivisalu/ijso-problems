\ifStatement
A given ray of light suffers deviation close to minimum deviation in an equilateral glass prism $P$. Additional glass prisms $Q$ and $R$ are identical to $P$ are now added close to each other as shown in the figure. If the emerged ray from $P$ enters $Q$ and continues to $R$, then this ray will emerge from $R$ with

\ifOption1
Greater deviation.
\fi


\ifOption2
Same deviation as if P is kept alone.
\fi


\ifOption3
Total internal reflection.
\fi


\ifOption4
No deviation.
